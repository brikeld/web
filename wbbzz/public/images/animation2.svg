            “Greek literature, the cornerstone of Western culture, spans epic poetry, drama, philosophy, and history, reflecting the depth of human experience. From Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey, which explore heroism and fate, to the timeless tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides, Greek writers delved into themes of morality, suffering, and the divine. Philosophers like Plato and Aristotle expanded literature into a realm of critical thought, shaping ethics, politics, and art. The histories of Herodotus and Thucydides, meanwhile, offer a window into the past, illuminating the rise and fall of empires. Together, these works form a rich tapestry of ideas and emotions, inspiring generations to seek truth, beauty, and meaning in a complex world.”
